# Transforming Customer Support with Generative AI on Google Cloud

##  Problem Statement

Customer support teams across industries face increasing challenges:
- **High volumes of repetitive queries**

- **Growing customer expectations for instant, personalized help**

Traditional models—manual triaging and scripted chatbots—struggle to:
- Scale effectively
- Understand context
- Offer flexible, real-time assistance

Despite digital transformation efforts, many enterprises still deal with:
-  Slow response times due to human bottlenecks  
-  Limited 24/7 support coverage  
-  Inconsistent customer experiences  
-  High operational costs  

These issues impact both **customer satisfaction** and **internal efficiency**.
